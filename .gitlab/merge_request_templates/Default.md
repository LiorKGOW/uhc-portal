# details

<!--
an auto-generated list of the MR commits.  if any commit titles include a type prefix
(e.g. "fix", "feat", "docs"), the list will be categorized by type.  
if you only see {all_commits} here but no text was generated, cancel and re-open the MR.

# ticketing

<!-- state the ticket or tickets this MR pertains to, e.g. "closes HAC-nnn, HAC-mmm".  
note that "fixes", "closes" or "resolves" (case-insensitive) will automatically
move the ticket(s) to "review" upon merge.  
to avoid this, you can use e.g. "addresses HAC-nnn" -->
