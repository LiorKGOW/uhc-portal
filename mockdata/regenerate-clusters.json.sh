# This script serves two roles:
#  1. Run locally to generate new subscriptions.json, clusters.json collections
#     from individual subscriptions/*.json, clusters/*.json responses.
#     - In this case, modifying the collections is expected, `git status` is just informative.
#     * Inconsistency between subscriptions/clusters is an error.
#  2. Run in CI to test committed data is consistent.
#     * In this case, if the collections changed it's an error â€” files in git were inconsistent.
#       => This is checked with `git diff` in pr_check.sh.
#     * Inconsistency between subscriptions/clusters is an error.  Checked by this script.
