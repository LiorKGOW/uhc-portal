                As Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) has moved to become a more agile and rapidly deployable Kubernetes offering, we want to allow existing and evaluation customers and partners access to the latest pre-release nightly builds to see a real-time view into the next version of OpenShift.

                These nightly builds are useful for those who would like to stay up to date on features being developed in the next release of OpenShift. Such builds are advantageous for planning future deployments, ISV integrations, or other educational purposes.

                Each OpenShift minor release will target initiatives or focus areas. These features will not be the same in every nightly build. Because these are experimental nightly builds, some features may be incomplete or have bugs. This is the beauty of the development process.
