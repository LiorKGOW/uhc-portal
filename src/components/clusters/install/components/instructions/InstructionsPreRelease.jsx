          <p>
            As Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) has moved to become a more
            agile and rapidly deployable kubernetes offering, we want to allow
            existing and evaluation customers and partners access to the latest
            pre-release nightly builds to see a real-time view into the next version
            of OpenShift.
          </p>

          <p />

          <p>
            Because these are developer preview builds:
          </p>
          <ul className="dev-preview-warnings">
            <li>
              Production use is not permitted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Installation and use is not eligible for Red Hat production support.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clusters installed at pre-release versions cannot be upgraded.
              As we approach a GA milestone with these nightly builds, we will
              allow upgrades from a nightly to a nightly; however, we will not
              support an upgrade from a nightly to the final GA build of OCP.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            These nightly builds are useful for those who would like to stay up
            to date on features being developed in the next release of OpenShift.
            Such builds are advantageous for planning future deployments,
            ISV integrations, or other educational purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Feature Completion in Nightly Builds
          </h3>

          <p>
            Each OpenShift minor release will target initiatives or focus areas.
            These features will not be the same in every nightly build.
            Because these are experimental nightly builds, some features
            may be incomplete or have bugs. This is the beauty of the development process.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following features have passed automated testing in the current OCP 4.2
            dev preview nightly builds:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Microsoft Azure IPI installation method
            </li>
            <li>
              Google Cloud Platform IPI and UPI installation method

          </ul>

          <p>
            The following features have not passed automated testing in the
            OCP 4.2 dev preview nightly builds, but will be completed in a
            future nightly build:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Red Hat OpenStack IPI installation method

            <li>

              your organizationâ€™s internet proxy)
