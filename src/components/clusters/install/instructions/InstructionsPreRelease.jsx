            As Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) has moved to become a more
            agile and rapidly deployable Kubernetes offering, we want to allow
            existing and evaluation customers and partners access to the latest
            pre-release nightly builds to see a real-time view into the next version
            of OpenShift.
                </p>

                <p />

                <DeveloperPreviewStatements />

                <p>
            These nightly builds are useful for those who would like to stay up
            to date on features being developed in the next release of OpenShift.
            Such builds are advantageous for planning future deployments,
            ISV integrations, or other educational purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>
            Feature Completion in Nightly Builds
                </h3>

                <p>
            Each OpenShift minor release will target initiatives or focus areas.
            These features will not be the same in every nightly build.
            Because these are experimental nightly builds, some features
            may be incomplete or have bugs. This is the beauty of the development process.
                </p>

                <p>
            The following features are being targeted for the OpenShift 4.5 release and will
            eventually be working in the nightly builds as they approach production readiness:

        inside the mirror URLs. We strongly advise using the 4.5 nightlies until OpenShift 4.5
        is released.
